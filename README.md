Group 8: Shirt Simplify
In the custom t-shirt printing industry, a large challenge for customers is balancing the cost of printing with design. The more colors a design has, 
the higher the production costs. At times, users may have to sacrifice their images, choosing less creative and appealing images, as they are too costly 
to produce. Shirt Simplify aims to tackle these stuggles by accepting shirt designs and reducing the number of colors in the design so that the printing
cost is cheaper. The users are able to download their modified design and input it into any custom shirt website.
